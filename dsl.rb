#simple program, in a domain language, that is expanded to do more complex things

#if security is an issue, stay away from internal DSLsâ€”far, far away. After all, the whole point of an internal DSL is that you take some arbitrary code that someone else wrote and suck it into your program. That requires a toothbrush- sharing level of trust.
